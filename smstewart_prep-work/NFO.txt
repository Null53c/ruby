	Event_Work: 
		I did the 3 iterative problems that were not required because they seemed fun and I wanted to find efficent solutions..
		I changed around how the script functions when executed with some user input etc to display the data created by the 3 iterative methods.

	Test-First Ruby:
		Completed problems 1-15.
	
	"rake_all_specs.sh" is a simple script I created for fun to recursively execute a 'rake' command in all of the example problem folders 
						in learn_ruby-master.  It's satisfying to see so much green (Because it passing obvi :P) fly through the terminals.
						Output is also written to rake_output.txt but there is no color highlighting of course!
